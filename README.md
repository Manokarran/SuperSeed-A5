# Description
For any project, there are few stpes to be configured first to start with which can be time consuming. To avoid the repetitive work, I tried to incorporate basic structure. I am using jasonplaceholder sample API; this is a test API, so it actually doesnt perform any action. This test API is used to demonstrate how HTTPClinet works.

1. HTTP CLient was introduced from Angular 4.3 onwards, it has more interesting functionalities compared to previous HTTP module. This seed project as HTTP Clint implementation
2. This seed project has Exception Handing Layer
3. It has toast control to display messages
4. It uses Bootstrap 4 module (ngb) and which inturn uses Bootstratp styles version 4
5. I use INTERCEPTORS for Logs and authentication which traces all HTTP requests from the application

Note: This is not a complete project, its built to help any developers who is starting a new Angular application
I am actively working on this prototype to include more components like eCharts, ag-grid, ngPrime Components to have a fully functional project template.
